FEATURE SELECTION:
Feature selection is one of the basic thing in the EDA process,as from the youtube videos i can say,this step is very very important in the
model building.This selection determine our building model,as also the accuracy of the model depends on the feature selection.
As also our 60 % to 70% of the time is gone in feature selection.

Coming to the missing value part,
To handle the missing values in the data set we have 3 steps involved;
1)Deletion of the record->Strict note;this step has to be used only when the dataset is large,when the dataset is small avoid using it.
2)Creating a separate model->more time,computations effort is also more(whichever are having the missing value,we can consider it as a test
data,and remaining will be used for training data.
3)Statistical method->It is the best method;mean(averge),median(after ascending and descending order ,middle value ),mode(frequency).
