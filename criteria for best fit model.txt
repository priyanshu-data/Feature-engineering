How to know if the model is best fit for your data?
The most common metrics to look at while selecting the model are:

STATISTIC	CRITERION
R-Squared	Higher the better (> 0.70)
Adj R-Squared	Higher the better
F-Statistic	Higher the better
Std. Error	Closer to zero the better
t-statistic	Should be greater 1.96 for p-value to be less than 0.05
AIC	        Lower the better
BIC	        Lower the better
Mallows cp	Should be close to the number of predictors in model
MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error)	Lower the better
MSE (Mean squared error)	Lower the better
Min_Max Accuracy => mean(min(actual, predicted)/max(actual, predicted))	Higher the better
